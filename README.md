# stashaway-calculator

- No tests were made for this application. This is a considered a proof of concept (of sorts!)
- In the interests of adhering to "don't use 3rd party Components" and at the same time, not re-inventing the wheel, I have used html5's range input. I understand this is still not compatible in all browsers.
- Due to time constraints, styling has been reprioritised.
- The range slider has considerably more 'points' than on the mockup design.
